These are my notes of the [*Modern Robotics*](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics) online course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/modernrobotics) introduced by [Prof. Kevin Lynch](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/lynch-kevin.html) from Northwestern University. 

This course has a very comprehensive [homepage](http://hades.mech.northwestern.edu/index.php/Modern_Robotics), including free textbook in pdf, related software, and many other helpful information. 

The purpose of these notes is to help quickly refresh the course materials, including textbook, course video, practice and quiz questions. All the notes are based on course materials and combined with my own understanding and extra information to the topics.

## $$\LaTeX$$ Support

Thanks to [Haixing Hu's tutorial](https://haixing-hu.github.io/programming/2013/09/20/how-to-use-mathjax-in-jekyll-generated-github-pages/) and [Gianluca Casati's tutorial](https://g14n.info/2014/09/math-on-github-pages/), I use Kramdown and MathJax to support $$\LaTeX$$ in my posts.
